I'm experiencing this weird issue. I tried a few apps (Teamviewer, Google Remote Desktop and another one I can't remember, which I found googling) and the windows don't display correctly. For instance, when I open a program by double clicking on an icon, the window doesn't show until I send a CTRL+ALT+DEL. And then, sometimes during the normal usage of that program, the window stops updating until I send a new CTRL+ALT+DEL. Anyone had this problem.

So, I started using Remotr to play BDO away from home and it works fine for an hour or so away from the LAN, but, then I am pretty sure Remotr shut down on my home PC because I can no longer connect to it after a few hours. It's been 2 days now and the first time it happened Remotr was not running in the background. It must be shutting down on it's own. I imagine the solution would be to run team viewer in concurrent to Remotr to boot it. Has anyone else experienced.

I want to use TeamViewer Host to remote control my Nexus 6 running Android 8.1, but it is not working. I realize that an add-on needs to be available for the phone in order for it to work, but I thought that the Android 7 add-on (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.quicksupport.addon.aosp7) would work since I am using 8.1 which is newer. Does anyone have any suggestions. Download this app from Microsoft Store for Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile. See screenshots, read the latest customer reviews, and compare ratings for TeamViewer: Remote Control. So here's the setup. My friends and I currently are using discord to stream movies and such to eachother via a discord call where we all join a call with a secondary discord account I setup on a whole seperate desktop. The idea is I login to discord, start a call, join the call with the second account, share its screen and play the videos through that. The reason for the second account is so we can all independently adjust its volume to each persons liking. It does work exactly the way we expect.
