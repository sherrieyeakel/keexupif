                            <p> Personally I would favour the USS Voyager. Once it acquired enhanced shielding it was just crazy. Nerf Voyager! That would have the added benefit of creating the ultimate plot twist. After 7 series of hard Sci Fi, they fail. They just fail. And they have to adapt as an independent colony in the gamma quadrant. Or die. Lord of the Flies in space. Another 7 good series in that alone - and a great life lesson: you can't keep your shields up forever. Hello everyone! I'm looking for sci-fi films that has the vibes of Deep Space Nine episodes, or even The Next Generation. You know, late 80s to maybe early 2000s space exploration films. Thanks. TOS, the TOS movies, TNG, and Generations all show space battles in Star Trek as being comparable to naval and submarine battles, with huge, slow-moving vessels firing at each other from a distance with a relatively low rate of fire but devastating impact. Then we move onto DS9, Voyager, ENT, DIS, and the other TNG movies, where space battles are depicted as dogfights in space. With starships buzzing and zooming around the battlefield, guns blazing. Now, there's very little we can really Selling all the Gold key (some are Gold Key/Whitman) in my collection. The first batch of Gold Key comics is: pictures (https://imgur.com/gallery/9n9av0i) Star Trek #1 - - 0 Star Trek #2 - -  Doctor Solar #30 - - Doctor Solar #31 - - Captain Nice #1 - -  Space Ghost #1 - -  The Green Hornet #1 - -  Astro Boy #1 - -  Underdog #1 - - Underdog #3 - - Second batch of Gold Key comics are solely Magnus, Robot Fighter: pictures (https://imgur.com/gallery/y2xqlxo) Magnu. 
I am a massive sucker for epic space battles and none have been portrayed better in all of Trek than the duel between the Enterprise and the Reliant in TWOK. I still await for this to be matched or even bettered in terms of scope, drama and pathos. When the trailer for First Contact (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcbmkdsFYs) was released I was excited beyond belief - what was this? a bigger and better version of The Best of Both Worlds, widely considered to be the best TNG episode? Platform(s): Amiga/DOS. Also had an Atari 500, but looking through Atari game databases I couldn't find anything like this game. Genre: Turn-based space combat game Estimated year of release: 90s, maybe late 80s Graphics/art style: Top down, with sprites I think, with menus being in the classic Star trek console (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/5c/60/475c60fc820428706e41a8661daf977e.jpg) style. Notable characters: You piloted a federation space ship. I don't remember. This is more a character design and writing question. And I still feel Farscape did a better job at character design. But in space or in the Star Trek Universe, do you see highly intelligent beings that can communicate and they have a much larger skeletal system. Most of the aliens appear in human size, 4-8 feet. But I imagine you could have aliens that are much larger in size, maybe 100 feet tall. And if that is the case, wouldn't that change the dynamic of the most powerful races I took a bunch of Star Trek pictures I found on the web (not all of them are probably from the movies/serieses, some of them are fan art themselves) and ran them through the Prisma filter ( which uses artificial intelligence/neural networks to make them look like art.

Game shows Past Tense is a two-part episode from the third season of science fiction television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 57th and 58th episodes overall This article consists almost entirely of a plot summary. It should be expanded to provide more balanced coverage that includes real-world context. A new documentary exploring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine argues that the show was underappreciated compared with previous Star Trek series.
